# PHP-codeigniter-project-CRUD-opertions
Management system with all CRUD opertions and explaining codeigniter framework working.



MVC will divide an application into three functional parts:

Models — deals with your database, carries out computations, and more. In short, it is where your business logic is located.
Views — forms the presentation layer of the application, where the data from your models are embedded.
Controllers — used to connect models and views. A controller will route user requests to the appropriate model. After that, once the model has done its job, the controller loads the relevant view.
This architectural pattern also gives developers the flexibility to reuse code for multiple views. For example, you can apply the same navigation bar on every webpage of your application.

Moreover, as both views and models are entirely separate, the front-end developers can work in parallel with the back-end team to speed up the development process.

Note that CodeIgniter also subscribes to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). As such, models and controllers are PHP classes that extend the base classes provided by the framework.

Views are also called PHP files, but the bulk of their content is HTML/CSS. Only a few snippets of PHP code are present, which are used to display the data from models.
